## Project Overview
 
Verydorm is an innovative platform built for the Base Buildathon Africa, aiming to transform property management through a combination of user-friendly interfaces, the transparency of blockchain technology, and the utility of our native Verydorm Coin.
 
Our demo showcases the following key features:
 
* **Property Listing Section:** A seamless way for users to view available properties and list their own.
* **Property Management Section:** Allowing property owners to entrust Verydorm with managing their properties, including handling repairs, rent collection, and maintenance.
* **Blockchain Integration:** Demonstrating how property-related records are securely stored, viewed, and searched on the Base blockchain for enhanced transparency and immutability.
* **Verydorm Coin Ecosystem:** Highlighting our native coin ([https://coin.verydorm.com/](https://coin.verydorm.com/)), which enables buying, swapping, and powers the Verydorm ecosystem.
* **Stablecoin Integration:** Showcasing our collaboration with stablecoins like USDT for reliable and efficient rent collection.
